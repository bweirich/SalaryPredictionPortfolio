# SalaryPredictionPortfolio
Salary Prediction Project (Python) This repository contains the python code for a Salary Prediction project. Details of the project can be read in the notebook.

Problem - 
The issue being looked at in this project is predicting the correct salary to offer to new hires. The company will want to be able to offer competitive salaries to acquire the best talent available while also being conscious of budgetary constraints. The project will look at the features that most effect the salary to create a model that can accurately predict the salary an individual should receive based on that individuals features.

Hypothesize solution - I have chosen to use the Linear Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to test to find the mosts accurate model predictions. The baseline predictions should have a Mean Square Error (MSE) less than 360.

Select best model - Based on the baseline goal of a MSE less the 360 the best model is Gradient Boosting with a MSE of 357.47
